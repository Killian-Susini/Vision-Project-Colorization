# Vision-Project-Colorization

Here is the project of Killian Susini for the VIC course of 2022. 

To use this code, you first need to follow the instruction to install pymeanshift at https://github.com/fjean/pymeanshift.

Then you should install the dependencies with pip install -r requiremnts.txt

Finally, use 

python colorization.py --target /path/to/target/image --reference path/to/reference 

The final colorized image will be stored in result.png

You can also use --verbose to see more of the intermediate steps
